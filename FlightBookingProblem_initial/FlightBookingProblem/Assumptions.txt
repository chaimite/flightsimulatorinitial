I assume that:
	- I can hard code the existing planes for feature 3
	- That for feature 2: 
			- the capacity still needs to be checked
			- that there was no need to inform the user that it changed to relaxed rules or to default rules
			- that there is a need to move between default and relaxed rules


To move between relaxed and default rules you can type at any moment relaxed or default, depending on which rules you
wish to apply.
